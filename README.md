# Keylogger

In this project, I've created a Python script that logs keystrokes on a Windows computer and sends those keystrokes to a server (Linode server) on the internet.

I've spun up a small Linode server, SSHed to the server, and started an express service to the server:

I can connect to the server's IP address:

No data has been logged on the server but it is listening.

Now we compile this Python script:

Nothing happens but the process is running:

We open now the notepad to write some notes:

and the information you write is logged to my server on the internet and the web interface!:
